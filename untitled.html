The optical capabilities of spiders in the electrostatic field, that has an effect on both the human and machine. Hypotheses explain how spiders die in such a way that their bodies remain hollow, as well as the survival and weakness of their threads for several reasons. Other problems can be related to spiders such as extracting skin surrounding the eye. \end{Summary}</div><div></div><div>\section{Introduction}</div><div>When we think of the history of ancient civilizations, we are amazed at the great achievements of that era, despite the limited possibilities of that time, and we wonder how these people reached the level of this engineering precision and other sciences in astronomy, etc. What causes some civilizations to practice certain religious rituals, as well as taking them to the temples to bury their dead and so on. Is only man who possesses knowledge without other creatures? But we find the opposite—for that another question arises, how can humans learn from these beings and vice versa? Can we explain the mystery of life and the separation of truth and myth or both sides of one thing!</div><div>This topic discusses the characteristics of spiders theoretically in terms of similarity with the behavior of humans in the past as well as the way of nutrition and ways of research, (i.e., the reasons that made some spiders moving towards a certain behavior). Perhaps as a result of being influenced by a some view in an earlier time and in a different environment, as well as do the spiders suffer diseases related to mind and consciousness as paraniod.</div><div>\subsection{Hypotheses}</div><div>Spiders are arrogant and want eternity.</div><div>Spider is an electrostatic emitter.</div><div>Spiders are creatures of one of the worlds in the multi-universe.</div><div>Spiders have extraordinary abilities in optics and memory, which have borrowed some of the laws of engineering from another world—where they were.</div><div></div><div>\section{The psychology of spiders}</div><div>Which world did the spiders came from? How spiders gained science in optics and chemistry that did not match the environment like the Earth's environment?</div><div>Why does the spider take a web (as house)?</div><div>How we can conclusion the psychology of spiders through their social behaviors?</div><div>Why does the spider take a web? Suppose, perhaps, in her mind and because of the superlative knowledge that she made the home of eternity. Why do spiders die and their bodies remain hollow? Let's assume that, they die through certain sound waves, which keep them just as hollow structure.</div><div>Through reading information about some spiders we can summarize some of the behaviors of those spiders, especially spiders that use Orb-weaver (i.e., Eriophora transmarina, Black widow spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, etc), as well as those female spiders which kill the male spiders, after mating in order for the female to absorb the liquid from his body. Perhaps the female kills the male to be taken as a sacrifice for the survival of the web, which gives her food. Obviously, social relations between spiders are short periods (just for the sake of interest) and then disintegrate and lead to infighting among them, as well as these spiders use temptations (web) to attract males, etc. There are also similarity in social behavior between those spiders and humans who were in the past, such as piracy (bandits). And also those spider webs cannot resist dust-laden winds, as well as not eternal. However, they build their homes in sandy places and on trees—in unsafe places. When the web was made with great engineering, but its threads lack the effect and vitality, so this network will not benefit the spider as it hopes—except catching prey.</div><div></div><div>\section{Evaluation of spiders' behavior according to genetic manipulation}</div><div></div><div>The genome of spiders is affected by the environment as in humans, so genetic manipulation of a given behavior can become genetic traits passed through generation reproduction. Further, their pattern of behavior, survival, hunting and reproduction suggests that they were in a more sophisticated environment than ours planet (Earth). We will summarize their behaviors as:</div><div>They are just a pirate spider (takes an insect effort).</div><div>They are lazy, and treacherous.</div><div>They are deceptive, take the effort of other insects without fatigue.</div><div>They are arrogant to her knowledge of optics.</div><div>They are transcendent on the livelihood of God. Therefore, does not rule out its relationship to the phenomenon of extracting skin surrounding the eye from cattle and humans to absorb certain Juicer (i.e., Crystalline proteins, neurotransmitters, etc.) This leads us to say that when spiders absorb these fluids from around the eyes, to strengthen and develop their thread—to become super-threads and not just traps to hunt prey as well as ensure them to stay longer or immortality. Thus, the secret of its web engineering is probably derived from another, (that means from a world that parallel to our), due to its sense of transcendence. Further, spiders are creatures of one of the worlds in this universe—just like humans. When comparing the behavior of the spider to the behavior of humans, we will find common ground between them, especially as these acts are a means of survival of both. Where the negative behaviors practiced by spiders at a certain point in time have become encoded within their own genome. In other words, there are acquired genetic traits that occur in conjunction with molecules, which occur between molecules as a result of molecular recognition of the surface and thus become available to similar molecules (negative thinking behaviors) to recombination of the molecules to form a genetic tangent complex. When compared to human behavior, criminals (who have been robbing, pirating, and injustice in the past) and spiders have a reciprocal behavioral effect due to the emission of the energy of the spherical molecules (interact representation) that have contributed to the exchange of encodings of a replicator molecule that stimulates other molecules—lead to exchange of genetic traits. Some spiders are the epitome of a replicator molecule, which has the ability to stimulate other similar molecules, so spiders have the ability to influence human behavior as well as to perceive their thoughts and sight.</div><div>In comparison with the wolf spiders who prefer to looks for food without webs, while other spiders that make the web in the case of catching the horse to absorbs the liquid from inside the body of the prey, to getting the nectar of flowers that the insects had eaten before they fell into a trap—not eat the corpse. They are robbed by the organic extract.</div><div>This is aggressive behavior and piracy to others as happens between humans. These behaviors in the consciousness of spiders are a means of intelligence in gaining food without effort, and thought that they are able to feed themselves without the need for others and here embodied the manifestations of greatness, dependency and dispense with those spiders.</div><div>‘It may has a universe of its own’, In its opinion. Moreover, the behavior of some spiders is an abnormal behavior—because some spiders make the effort to hunt.</div><div></div><div>\section{Conclusions}</div><div>There may be spiders larger than these known, in somewhere.</div><div>And there are other spiders have an electrostatic capacity and may possibly disrupt communication devices. They also play a role in changing the person's mood, especially the wolf spider. “The human body was discovered to funcrion as a strong antenna and/or receiver for electrostatic body-motions” (Schwartz, Gary ER, et al. 1996). When the wolf spider was placed in the bedroom and every now and then you feel the erection of your head hair towards the spider position. It happened for the first time without the knowledge that there was a spider. Moreover, the spider is an electrostatic emitter and this is probably one of the causes of the Columbia shuttle crash. These spiders believe that their network represents their own universe structure. Structure of body is proportional to the environment from which it came and also helps in adaptation (gravity). There is a mutual effect between humans and spiders, and this is a guide to taking spiders for phishing methods that are derived from human behavior such as hacking (ambushes) and vice versa.</div><div>Some ancient civilizations borrowed engineering from spiders as well as beliefs that believed in immortality. Moreover, they (ancient humanity) mimicked the representation of these works by building monuments, palaces, and temples that ensured their survival and also protected them from danger, (as they claim).</div><div>The spider's geometry is derived from the geometry of another world, due to the spider's ability in electrostatics—knowledge of human not yet completed in the field of electrostatics, this has enabled spiders to simulate that of the geometric form (which inspired spiders to make their web). I assume that some ancient civilizations of mankind took this science of spiders in the hope of gaining immortality, and thus built architecture.</div><div>Both the spider and its threads are affected by certain sound waves which contains cold wind, that lead to attenuation of the threads, although the body of the spider is exposed to sound frequencies and cold wind waves, that contains&nbsp; certain frequencies to make its web an body just as hollow and dry—unlike the rest of the other creatures.</div><div>These spiders become as neurologic as humans are. There are similarities in many areas, and this is why we need to look more closely at the relationship between humans and spiders.</div><div>Perhaps in the future if and only if, this area is interesting (as spiders project), scientists may find amazing results that would explain some ambiguity of the universe. We may draw conclusions about Alzheimer's and cancer as well as space science.</div><div>Spiders have an optical ability and thus can read human thought and influence their behavior. The spiders are also the electrostatic conductors.</div><div>The shape of the spider is a template for containing the intellectual encodings as well as re-linking the molecules.</div><div>The spider releases electrostatic waves and can be identified through the erection of hair.</div><div>Behavioral interaction occurs between the spider and humans due to molecular similarities between them, according to the coupling-complementary.</div><div>There are behavioral differences between spiders, some have behavioral abnormalities while the other still normal. Moreover, the world of spiders is like the world of humanity, in terms of behavior change and acts.</div><div>In the past, humans have acquired behaviors from spiders, unconsciously, for this, there are similar processes in the brain, especially visual information, but spiders are smarter than human, because they exist before humanity.</div><div>Spiders use the visual and optical cells of other organisms to develop their genes and to survive longer.</div><div>Hair is affected by contact with an electrostatic charge. Therefore, hair plays a sensor role in receiving electrostatic charges.</div><div>If we can talk to spiders via a smart device, we can get important information about universe.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>\section{References}</div><div></div><div>Schwartz, Gary ER, et al.
